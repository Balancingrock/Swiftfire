This does not constitute a promise for implementation, just a list of improvements that I am thinking about.

Note: It is possible that this document is not up to date. All improvements must be marked by a "***I***" marker in the source code (followed by a number in brackets). Search for them to ensure that nothing is missed.

1) System overload reaction.
----------------------------

In HttpConnection the "forceClose" flag is present that is raised when a process must terminate the ProcessHttpRequest must terminate itself. The current algorithm used to free connection objects may result in an inability to service any request. Evaluate if a better algorithm should be implemented.

2) Abort client connection
--------------------------

When the connection must be terminated in response to an abort request, it is closed without regard for potential remaing HttpWorker processes that might still be running. This can result in the loss of messages to the client. Investigate if it would be better to wait until the HttpWorker processes are ready before closing the connection. Note: It is even possible that not all Http requests are found before the close, possibly abort that process as well?
