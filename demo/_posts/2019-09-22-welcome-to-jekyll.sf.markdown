Welcome to Swiftfire and Jekyll.

Jekyll is a static site generator for blog posting, personal sites or small business sites. We use it for our websites and it is a perfect companion to Swiftfire. Jekyll takes care of the basic site layout, and Swiftfire provides the dynamic aspects.

This demo site shows how one could use Swiftfire to create an interactive website. Even when using static site generators. While you won't see any PHP here, this is not because it cannot be done, but rather because we created Swiftfire to replace PHP. However, Swiftfire plays nice with PHP and you can use Swiftfire and PHP together.

This demo site uses our Classic-Jekyll-Theme, in the future we hope to enhance this theme with Swiftfire functions and issue a Swiftfire-Jekyll-Theme.
