# Requested features

This does not constitute a promise for implementation, nor is it ordered in a specific sequence, it is just a list of features that I am thinking about or have been requested.

| Number | Title/Description | Status
|:-:|:--|:-:|
| 1 | Add a redirect file that maps Http requests to a new destination. I.e. the file should contain something like an "old URL" to "new URL" mapping. | Open
| 2 | Allow some directories to display a list of content when the directory itself is requested | Open
| 3 | Allow more than 1 server admin | v1.2.0
| 4 | Implement domain admins | v1.2.0
| 5 | Remove dependancy on 'HTML', the new multi-line strings in Swift obliviate the purpose of this library | Done
| 6 | Remove the need to _save_ when updates are made by the server administrator | Open
| 7 | Add more logging such that all updates to the server by the admin are logged at the _notice_ level | Open
