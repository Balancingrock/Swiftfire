This does not constitute a promise for implementation, just a list of features that I am thinking about.

0001: Redirect file

Add a redirect file that maps Http requests to a new destination. I.e. the file should contain something like an "old URL" to "new URL" mapping."


0002: 404 URL list

Automaticall create a file with all URLs that caused a 404 to occur. This file should probably have a counter field for every time a certain URL was accessed. The layout should be very similar to the "Redirect file" (see FR-0001) so that the user may use the content of the 404 URL file to update the Redirect file.


0003: Custom 404 page

Each domain should have its own custom 404 page that is returned for a 404 error.


0004: Custom redirect page

Before redirecting (See FR-0001) each domainshould have it own custom redirect page that informs a user that the URL is outdated.


0005: Deny directory access

Disallows directory access, but implement a list -per domain- that allows some directories to be accessed. I.e. if a user requests a directory listing this should be disallowed by default, unless the directory is listed in the list of allowed directories.


0006: IP Address logging

Maintain a list that shows which IP address acessed which URL how often and when.


0007: IP Address blacklist

Disallow specified IP addresses from accessing any content at all.
