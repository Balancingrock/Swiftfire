This does not constitute a promise for implementation, just a list of features that I am thinking about or have been requested.

0001: Redirect file

Add a redirect file that maps Http requests to a new destination. I.e. the file should contain something like an "old URL" to "new URL" mapping."


0002: 404 URL list (done)

0003: Custom 404 page

Each domain should have its own custom 404 page that is returned for a 404 error.


0004: Custom redirect page

Before redirecting (See FR-0001) each domainshould have it own custom redirect page that informs a user that the URL is outdated.


0005: Deny/Allow directory access (rejected, better solution is anticipated in a future relase.)

0006: IP Address logging (done)


0007: IP Address blacklist

Disallow specified IP addresses from accessing any content at all.


0008: Support HTTP 1.0 (done, v0.9.14)
