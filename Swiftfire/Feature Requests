This does not constitute a promise for implementation, just a list of features that I am thinking about or have been requested.


0001: Redirect file
-
Add a redirect file that maps Http requests to a new destination. I.e. the file should contain something like an "old URL" to "new URL" mapping."


0002: 404 URL list (done, pre v0.9.14)


0003: Custom 404 page (done, v0.9.14)
-
Each domain should have its own custom 404 page that is returned for a 404 error.


0004: Custom redirect page
-
Before redirecting (See FR-0001) each domain should have it own custom redirect page that informs a user that the URL is outdated.


0005: Deny/Allow directory access (rejected, better solution is anticipated in a future relase.)


0006: IP Address logging (done, pre v0.9.14)


0007: IP Address blacklist (done, v0.9.14)
-
Disallow specified IP addresses from accessing any content at all.


0008: Support HTTP 1.0 (done, v0.9.14)


0009: Add history for client access
-
Like for page/url history: a graph that shows the access per day over a certain time period.


0010: Support https (on port 443)
