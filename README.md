# Swiftfire
A webserver in pure Swift

Swifterfire is the end product of 5 packages that make up the Swiftfire webserver:

#####[SwiftfireConsole](https://github.com/Swiftrien/SwiftfireConsole)

A GUI application for Swiftfire.

#####[SwifterSockets](https://github.com/Swiftrien/SwifterSockets)

General purpose socket utilities.

#####[SwifterLog](https://github.com/Swiftrien/SwifterLog)

General purpose logging utility.

#####[SwifterJSON](https://github.com/Swiftrien/SwifterJSON)

General purpose JSON framework.

There is a 6th package called [SwiftfireTester](https://github.com/Swiftrien/SwiftfireTester) that can be used to challenge a webserver (any webserver) and see/verify the response.

#Note
This is an early public release and I do not consider this code ready for prime time. It is experimental in nature and subject to severe rewrites as development continues.

However: It does work! :-)
